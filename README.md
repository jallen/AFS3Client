# AFOS3Client

AFS3Client is an extension for [AFNetworking](http://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/) that simplifies the process uploading files to [Amazon's S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) service.

This is the most basic, featureless implementation possible as it only PUTs an object to S3. But it handles the messy process of creating the signature for an S3 request. 

Most of the code was borrowed from [ASIHTTPRequest](https://github.com/pokeb/asi-http-request).
